          1111111111111111111Actually, I think it depends what you actually want to get the coords of. The question is a little ambiguous. Your answer is correct if you just want the coords relative to the viewport or relative to the body element, but that doesn't help you in the case where you want the absolute position of the element (which I imagine is what most people want). meouw's answer doesn't give you that either, unless you remove the '-scrollLeft' and '-scrollTop' bits. – CpnCrunch Jul 3 '14 at 17:58
